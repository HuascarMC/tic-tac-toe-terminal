## Tic-tac-toe

*Still in development, this is the first stable version*

This project started as one tightly-coupled file that allowed the game to be played but very difficult to add functionality. It also didn't have a competent opponent/computer player because of it's previous 'thinking' algorithm.

It's been improved by refactoring all the code following SOLID principles and implementing MiniMax algorithm to make the computer player intelligent.

The file structure is very clear and it's separated in different components that integrate together in one file to make the game. Each component has been unit tested but more tests could be added.

## How to run

You'll need python version 3.6 to run the tests and the game. More detailed steps will be added soon but in the meantime try cloning the repo and running the 'game.py' file using the following command in terminal:
```
python3.6 game.py
```

## Things to be added

- UI

- More tests

- At the moment only (human vs computer) can be played (to_add)-> Different game types (human vs human, computer vs computer)
